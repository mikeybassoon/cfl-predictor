# CFL Predictor

A GUI app designed to answer questions about the Canadian Football League season and its likely outcomes, based on past results. This app is the successor to an earlier CLI app that was written in C++ and used simple coin-flip odds. The goal with this project is to use a more sophisticated statistical model to pull some more interesting data.

This is also very much a learning project. It'll start out in React and I may add other languages and tools as the project evolves.
