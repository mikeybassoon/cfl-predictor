# CFL Predictor

A GUI app designed to answer questions about the Canadian Football League season and its likely outcomes, based on past results. This app is the successor to an earlier CLI app that was written in C++ and used simple coin-flip odds. The goal with this project is to use a more sophisticated statistical model to pull some more interesting data.

Unfortunately, since starting this project I've learned that the CFL has quietly abandoned their API and that it will not return recent data. I'm ceasing work on this project for now but may return to it at some point.
